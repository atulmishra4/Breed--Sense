        <h1 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">About BreedSense</h1>

        <p className="text-justify mb-3"> BreedSense is an intelligent, image-based breed recognition platform designed to transform livestock
          management and conservation in India. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, computer vision,
          and data analytics, BreedSense enables accurate identification of indigenous cattle and buffalo breeds—such
          as Gir, Sahiwal, Murrah, Mehsana, and many more—directly from images.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mb-3">
          India’s livestock ecosystem is rich in diversity, yet farmers and officials often struggle with breed
          identification due to limited access to expert knowledge. Incorrect identification can lead to
          inefficiencies in breeding programs, inaccurate productivity assessment, and misallocation of government
          subsidies. BreedSense directly addresses these challenges through automation, transparency, and
          accessibility.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-3"> At its core, BreedSense functions as a mobile and web-based application that allows users to upload or
          capture a photo and instantly receive breed predictions powered by deep learning models. The system provides
          comprehensive breed information, including origin, physical traits, milk yield, and disease resistance,
          while supporting geo-tagging for monitoring regional breed distribution. Additionally, its multilingual
          interface ensures ease of use across India’s diverse rural communities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mb-3"> The mission of BreedSense is to democratize access to livestock intelligence by integrating advanced AI
          models into everyday agricultural practices. The platform promotes transparency, inclusivity, and innovation
          by reducing reliance on manual verification and expert intervention. For farmers, it simplifies
          decision-making and record-keeping; for government agencies, it enhances livestock census accuracy and
          policy formulation; and for researchers, it enables large-scale data collection for breed conservation.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-3">Technically, BreedSense leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning architectures
          such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and MobileNet for accurate and lightweight deployment. The backend, powered by
          Flask/FastAPI, integrates seamlessly with a user-friendly frontend built using React Native for mobile and
          web accessibility. To ensure usability in low-connectivity areas, the platform supports offline inference
          through TensorFlow Lite and ONNX models.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mb-3">By combining advanced AI with user-centric design, BreedSense provides a scalable foundation for future
          enhancements, including disease detection, milk yield prediction, and livestock marketplace integration. It
          can also integrate with national e-governance initiatives like the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, aligning with
          India’s vision of smart and sustainable agriculture.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mb-3">BreedSense stands at the intersection of technology, agriculture, and innovation, working to create a future
          where every farmer has access to intelligent, reliable, and affordable livestock solutions.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">The Origin Story</h3>

        <p className="text-justify mb-3">
          BreedSense was conceptualized with a clear understanding of India’s agricultural challenges—farmers rely
          heavily on indigenous cattle and buffalo breeds, yet lack accessible tools for correct identification and
          management. The founders witnessed how misidentification affected breeding outcomes, productivity, and
          eligibility for government support, leading to widespread inefficiencies.</p>
        <p className="text-justify mb-3">Recognizing the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision, the team set out to develop a system
          that could make breed recognition as simple as taking a photo. The goal was to bridge the gap between
          traditional farming knowledge and modern technology, ensuring that even farmers in remote areas could
          benefit from AI without requiring technical expertise.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mb-3">What started as a research concept soon evolved into a mission—to empower farmers, support government
          initiatives, and preserve India’s livestock heritage through digital innovation. This vision became the
          foundation of BreedSense.</p>
